# Lily-DMData
LilyDMData is an easy way for english-speaking developers (or anyone, really!) to interface with the [DMData](https://dmdata.jp) API.
**This library currently only supports earthquake-based connections.**

This is EXTREMELY early development! It is NOT ready for reliable use!s

Install with `npm i lily-dmdata`
